Repository contains "Pymaceuticals" directory. within this directory there is a directory "data" containing the .csv files used for this project. Additionally, there are 2 jupyter notebook files:
	a) pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb - provided starter code. DO NOT USE FOR GRADING
	b) main.ipynb - this is the file in which I developed code to complete the assignment.


In performing the analysis, the requested graphs stop short of some of the analyses I would have performed in the real-world. For instance, instead of just looking at the final tumor size of mice treated under certain regimens, I would've calculated the change in tumor size over time and looked for the regimen that caused the greatest decrease most frequently.

Additionally, please note that I tried experimenting with code and formatting wherever possible. I used various sources which taught me skills such as applying data labels to bar graphs and using the count of each pie chart slice instead of the percentage. Any complex code that I did not develop has a reference commented in. While I didn't assign colors to all graphs as it did not feel necessary, I did change colors on certain graphs, as well as experimenting with various color applications to the boxplot. I know that the boxplot may not look "business professional," however, I took the liberty of doing this to show how I've learned to manipulate these visualizations.
